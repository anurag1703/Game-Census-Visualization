# Big Game Census Analytics
## Project Overview
The Big Game Census Analytics project explores the distribution of Super Bowl players' birthplaces and analyzes their relationship with state and local population data. Using Python for data preparation and Power BI for data visualization, this project delivers insightful dashboards and reports to reveal patterns and trends in player origins.

## Objectives
-Analyze the birthplace data of Super Bowl players and their associated state populations.

-Create interactive dashboards showcasing player distribution and population statistics.

-Provide insights into players per capita and state-wise trends using data visualization tools.
## Key Features
**Data Integration:**

-Merged Super Bowl player data with state and local population datasets.

-Derived insights such as total players per state and players per capita.

**Data Visualization:**

-Developed Streamlit Interface with interactive visualizations:

-Geographic maps of player distribution.

-Bar charts showing player counts per state.

-Analysis of players relative to population (players per capita).

**Automated Workflow:**

-Python scripts for data preprocessing, integration, and exporting datasets for visualization.

**Datasets Used:**
Big Game Census data.xlsx:

-Contains Super Bowl player information, including names, teams, and birthplaces.

*All states Census 2017 Population Estimates.xlsx:*

-Provides state-level population estimates for 2017.

*All Places Census 2016 Population Estimates.xlsx:*

-Includes local population estimates for 2016.

## Technologies Used
### Programming and Data Processing:
**Python:**

Libraries: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
    
    -Used for data cleaning, merging, and basic exploration.

### Data Visualization:
**Streamlit & Pandas-Profiling:**

-Created interactive dashboards for presenting insights dynamically.


## Key Insights
-States with the highest number of Super Bowl players.

-Correlation between state population and player production.

-States with the most players relative to their population size.

## Future Enhancements
-Automate data updates with Python scripts.

-Integrate advanced analytics to predict trends in player origins.

-Expand the project to include historical Super Bowl player data.
